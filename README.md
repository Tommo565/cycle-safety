# cycle-safety

My work on Cycling Safety throughout the last year or so. It's very hack-y which I'll apologise in advance for but I enjoyed (and am enjoying) working on it and hopefully someone else will be able to take it forward and do something useful with it in the future, hence the decision to share it on github.

Contains an .ipynb file for Jupyter fans and a .py file for everyone else.

Thanks,

Tom
